Hello, welcome to the Jimmy Jumper Demo thing as you can see this is the default branch 1.0.0 this is not a finished version of the betas or alphas if anything,
this is just a bare bones version of the game built to let people mod in their own levels.
So how you mod this game is pretty simple, you download GDevelop download the source code of this game and then uncompress the game then you go into the Build tab on the left
Scroll down and click the open a project button and then once you have that clicked then choose on PC and then go to wherever you saved it and go into the My Project 2 folder
inside of the Jimmy Jumper.zip file and then click onto Dark Noise.json (Dark Noise was a default name I wasn't able to change it) so once you do that download a music software
of choice and download a pixel art software of choice or you can just use Piskel (If you want a good pixel art thing use Libresprite, not Piskel) and then you can mod it.
